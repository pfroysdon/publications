When I learn a new topic, I organize my thoughts in a way that I can refer to them in the future, and I post them here. Herein are my notes on several math topics relevant to statistical learning (machine learning), e.g. [algebra](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Math_Notes/Algebra.pdf), [calculus](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Math_Notes/Calculus.pdf), [probability theory](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Math_Notes/Probability_Theory.pdf), etc., as well as notes on various machine learning algorithms, e.g. [linear regression](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Math_Notes/Linear_Regression.pdf), [hypothesis testing](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Math_Notes/Hypothesis_Testing.pdf), etc.. In many cases these are intended to be a summary or a cheat-sheet for future reference. I hope that you find these useful.

I have 35 more of these "notes" in various stages of completion. I will upload them in the near future.

While all of these have been peer-reviewed, I do not guarantee that they are free of typographical errors.

Special Note: The math/stats/ML literature uses many variations on notation. Great pains have been taken to keep the notation consistent throughout my notes, in fact I have defined it [here](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Math_Notes/Notation.pdf). This way you are introduced to the notation and conventions once, and can spend the rest of your time learning the topic without re-learning notation each time.
