## A Comprehensive Approach to Data Science, Machine Learning & AI
<p align="center">

</p>

Drawing on decades of experience in the Intelligence Community and industry, Dr. Roysdon presents 57 of the most influential and often misunderstood algorithm families in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. Each chapter opens with a clear overview and an intuitive, non-mathematical illustration, followed by from-scratch LaTeX pseudocode and comprehensive code tutorials in MATLAB, Python, and R -- 264 in total, all freely downloadable from the author's website -- that reveal the core logic behind modern libraries. A dedicated section on mathematical derivations and proofs deepens understanding, while concise summaries of advantages, limitations, and real-world applications make this book equally valuable to technical and non-technical readers.

</p>

*Math Refresher for Data Science, Machine Learning & AI* offers a comprehensive review of the concepts, approaches and applications of linear algebra, statistics, and calculus for use in machine learning algorithms.
This book covers each topic using a concise and conceptual approach.
To make the book approachable for beginners, practitioners, and experienced folks, the text includes worked problems (examples) as well as exercises for the reader to complete, with solutions provided in the appendix.

This text is not intended to replace a college-level course in linear algebra, statistics, nor calculus. 
Rather the necessary material is provided to refresh what the reader previously learned, so that they will be ready to tackle machine learning problems and its applications in the field of Data Science.

## Math Handbook for Data Science, Machine Learning & AI
<p align="center">

</p>

*Math Handbook for Data Science, Machine Learning & AI* is the ensemble of notes gathered from my Ph.D. dissertation research on Machine Learning (ML) topics.
Fortunately, there exists a large body of literature on this subject.
However, much of the on-line material is confusing or inaccurate, with inconsistent nomenclature.
This text provides a reference of high school and first-year college math, so that anyone can refer to this text while performing their own research.

Features that distinguish this book from others:
The notation and analysis is developed and consistent across the chapters & fields of mathematics.
Great pains have been taken to compile a large body of mathematics literature into one concise and consistent notation.
Thus, the reader is introduced to the notation once, and can therefore spend the rest of their time refreshing their memory of algorithms instead of learning new notation.

## Optimal Nonlinear Bayesian Estimation and Sensor Fusion
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" img src="/figures/optimal.png" style="border-radius: 15px;>
</p>

*Optimal Nonlinear Bayesian Estimation and Sensor Fusion* is based on my my Ph.D. dissertation research on optimal nagivation system theory.
Many robotics applications require reliable, high precision navigation (error less than meter level) while using low-cost consumer-grade inertial and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). 
The application environment causes numerous GNSS measurement outliers. Common implementations use a single epoch Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) combined with the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) for GNSS outlier detection. 
However, if the linearization point of the EKF is incorrect or if the number of residuals is too low, the outlier detection decisions may be incorrect. 
False alarms result in good information not being incorporated into the state and covariance estimates. 
Missed detections result in incorrect information being incorporated into the state and covariance estimates. 
Either case can cause subsequent incorrect decisions, possibly causing divergence, due to the state and covariance now being incorrect. 
This text formulates a sliding-window estimator containing multiple GNSS epochs, and solves the full-nonlinear Maximum A Posteriori estimate in real-time. 
By leveraging the resulting window of residuals, an improved fault detection and removal strategy is implemented. 
Experimental sensor data is used to demonstrate the interval RAIM (iRAIM) performance improvement.
